Then we're going to just go download for Mac. All right. I got an Apple Silicon. Yeah. Let's just see what we got. So this is our first look at it, right? Yeah, I did. I accidentally did that on. I wonder why I like. Yeah, can I get like? All right, so we're going to see how we do this. So it's easy real easy download for Mac. It's a vs. Fork. So I suppose that it's just, you know, relatively easy. No, I wouldn't think that. This so we can be seeing on. Got this half screen so it can also run on tick-tock as well. Like this is like where we got to be for tick-tock. Yeah, we just do get her. I like it. Okay. Really really easy setup. Yeah, I want to import my vs. Code extensions. Yes, perfect. Because then I have to set up anything. Ah, yeah, this is awesome. Import all of my vs. Code. I said, we'll let this run. Yeah, I'm just to see what lovable did so far because bolt. And lovable. Okay. Okay, here we go. All right. So yeah, we want dark mode. Let's continue Kendrick integrates with your shale and allows you to open any project from the terminal. Okay, let's set up the shale. Yep. Sure. You can have permission. I had to put in my password. All right shale is boom. So I'll get to my. All right. Then we're going to open a project. So let's go and create a project. What do we say? This was called. This is called Ken circle, right? I think that's what it's called. Ken. It's called Ken circle in it. I think I forgot the name of it that fast. Ken circle. I pass it up. Come on new guy. What are you doing? Ken circle. All right. There we go. So we're going to go. I'm going to start a new project. I'm just going to go inside of my day. And this is going to be called new folder. Ken circle. Can circle. All right done. I'm going to go back into Cairo and open a project. Dave can circle open. All right. Do you trust the authors of this files? Yeah, I do. Yes. All right. So Clawed sonnet 4.0 autopilot. I like it. And so it's going to build out all the specs so I can go in vibe mode or I can go on the spec mode, huh? So let me zoom in a little bit man. I can't see it chat first then build. Spec plan first then build requirements then design. Oh, so I could have just did the requirements here. Like I did all the requirements here in chat GPT. So I wonder if I'll ask the same questions. And see what it does from this beginning. Like I'm going to go back and ask the same questions that I asked and then let's see what it does. So chat first, let's put in the idea and let's see what happens. Sounds like a really solid. Okay. Mobile act mobile first react native or Flutter for cross-platform. I didn't even think of Flutter as like a mobile application back in no JS. Of course Python. Yep. Family tree Network Builder the AI piece for optimal occasional. It's interesting. You can factor in travel distance. We're talking about generative AI to yeah. We are talking generative AI to not like I don't want to go into some kind of crazy. What was the next question? I asked I said, how much of this can I get done with vanilla like without any? This is and also but what do you think is best? We want light weight and lots of doc documentation for large language models to code with. Okay. Let's go a vanilla node on the back end simple build process. Use open AI simple rest. Yeah, I think yeah, Google Maps. I think so. I think we'll keep it Claude though. Or we even use Gemini search is Gemini still free. We're going to use Gemini. Yeah, I think so too. I agree. They can code this all day long without getting confused about react hook. Exactly. Exactly. All right, so I want to come back to this. Yeah, let's just see what it does. Yes, exactly. We need an MVP. Ship today. Let's ship today, bro. All right. All right, perfect. Let's get it. So we're going to see what Kiro what our boy Kiro gets done. Cairo. I don't know. Here it is. So you can see the whole screen. And then we make this tall. So I'm on the $200 Claude code plan and I'm just trying to see if anybody else is experiencing this. I know that it's being throttled for sure than it was 30 days ago. But what I think that's happening to save a bunch of your contacts or to be able to just save some of your usages to not allow the auto compact to happen. I've been I've been using it all day actually since maybe 9 a.m. this morning. I think everybody was just getting like two to maybe two and a half hours of usage time. Then I just start clearing the entire window on my own. I got to accept them. Yeah, I accept them. How do I accept? Yeah, I don't know how to accept so it stopped. But it where do I accept changes? Yes, do you all the changes? Okay. How do I accept them though? Like, how do I accept the changes? Alright, so that's not into it. I know if I hit revert, it's going to take me back if I exit out, maybe. Okay. Okay, perfect. Let's build it. Perfect. I built you a complete MVP family reunion planning app. Wow. Where is it? No, you didn't. Let's see. All right. Okay. Yeah, let's see index email. Okay, let's see what it looks like. Bring your family together. Okay, this is what this looks like family location plan. Oh, start planning. My family members name is Brandon Hoff my city and state like this would be we should automatically be able to just click in a it should automatically put in. I put in my zip code, right? Like that's probably what I would put in zip code and it gives me the city and state because you don't want people miss misspelling this see I am a TI see I'm already misspelling and then the formatting is off already. So my email is optional. So I add a member. Okay, let's add another let's add another one. Let's add court me. Carol and then let's say she in Nashville. Tennessee and is her cool. Let's just say hers is CC at gmail.com. Okay, and then find the best location. Okay, analyzing to family member locations family member Cincinnati Atlanta, Georgia, Nashville, Tennessee, Charlotte. And it gave his scores. My brother's lit. This is it. This is it, bro. This is where we go. Come back. What did I do with it? Here we go. Alright, this is it. Yeah, and then so I click on Atlanta Atlanta score. Plan event man, what suggested venues? Activities. What's the date? Give. No, no, this is it. Yeah, this is it. This is it. Let me get ready to launch this bro. A day. Let's say the date is August. Let's go. We can even plan for 2026 June 12 2026. Here go my venues generate a plan here. Go to plan Dallas, Texas. This is the day expected attendees cost send invitations to family members book venues coordinate travel arrangements. Would you like to upgrade to premium service for $49? Bruh, this is it. This is it. That's a family. You go my family. Here go the locations that I can go. Here's the plan. Here's home. This is this called family reunion. It's actually I let's see how lovable did real estate financing. Also boat accidentally. I messed up on boat. My bad. This is boat. I did. I made a mistake on this one. So actually, let's just look at lovable. Let's preview. Yeah, this is lovable. Dot Dev. Let's see how lovable. Dot Dev did. Okay, lovable. Added the photos. Are you proud? No, you're lovable. Lovable added the photos on you. Gee, hold on. Ken circle, man. I can't. It's the size is kind of janky. All right. There we go. Okay. Kim ready to plan your family reunion. Okay, I'm digging it. Try demo data. Okay, bring your family together with smart reunion plan and collect everyone's info. Okay, new reunion. Reunion name. Okay, just a half family. Reunion 2026. My name is Brandon. My email is Brandon's e-mail create a reunion. The half family reunion organized by Brandon's e-mail. Add a family member. You can even put auntie Sarah. Let's do auntie. Sarah. No, come on, man. Let's do Philip. No email. No, no. D. This is where I wish you would. Yeah, there we go. Number attending. Hmm. Why would you? Could you just put their family then? Cousin. Oh, yeah. This is even better. Cousin. They're going to prefer that either flower drive. Do they need will set? This is great or mobile. All this is so good. You can put their dietary restrictions here. Everything. This is awesome. I deleted it. Damn. So that's something that we have to say. So we're just going to put Brandon. My name. Child. Anyone. Add family member. Yes, this is good locations. We need at least two. Oh man, we're at another one. So let's go with. Yeah, we don't just let's go with Nashville. Tennessee. Yeah, we leave that and then this is put Graham and then add. 30333. Okay. And so then you could put locations find best locations, Charlotte, North Carolina, Atlanta. Yeah, this is this is crazy. Oh, yeah, this is good planning. This is another feature. So just give you locations reanalyze locations and give you a geographic Center. Yeah, I like it. Family members soon back. Yeah, here's a family reunion. It already has family is open this one. So this is the Johnson family in 2025 organized by Denise Johnson. So here's all the family reunions grandparent senior friendly. Fly number locations find best locations six families 22 attendees. Oh, so they just put like I don't understand how they put four members like I don't get the family members. Where you put auntie Sarah Johnson uncle Marcus Johnson and they three kids. Yeah, we would have to fix that. That's that's kind of weird. But reanalyze so of all the family members, how many states represented? Six families 22 attendees. Yeah, so you would just put inside of that family member you would put their their family represents, right? Like you would put the like Wilson's right put Wilson's or I put Hoffs, but it's the Hoff family reunion. So I probably would just put the name of the family member and then the kids that are associated to that family member how we're supposed to be recording this because then we are recording it. Yeah, heck. Yeah, because this becomes all of our planning. Okay, this is great. This is great. I think we have a very very good at family members find best location plan together. This is a very very simple MVP. That and so this is what lovable did and then this is what Cairo did. Here. So Cairo is this. And so I think it's good. So then we would build on this then we would build on this but this is a very very very good start.
